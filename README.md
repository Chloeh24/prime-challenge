# Findmypast prime multiplication challenge

<strong>Task: </strong> Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of the first (N) prime numbers

## How to run 
- `git clone` this repo
- run `npm install`
- start server with `npm run start`
- open localhost:3000
- run tests with `npm run test`

## What I'm pleased with
- Keeping the code simple and focusing on functionality
- Breaking down each of the required functions into succinct maintainable code
- Ensuring there were unit tests for each major function

## What I would do if I had more time
- Update the styling of the table so it's easier to read
- Add more tests
- Make the design of the application more dynamic and appealing, possibly with React
